<center><h1>Tower of Bramha</h1></center>
<p>Tower of Bramha is also referred to as Tower of Babel. This is a classic problem to demostrate the recursive algorithms.
The basic problem is move a given number of Rings, usually between 3 and 7, that are placed in the first column order such 
that the widest ring is at the bottom and decreasing to the smallest at the top.</p>
<p>Objective of the game is to move the stack of the rings to another column using the third column as a temporary holding spot in the least number of moves.</p>
<p>Here are the basic rules of the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one ring can be moved at one time.</li>
<li>A larger ring cannot be put on top of a smaller ring</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to think of the problem in its most basic steps. Say we are moving the rings to column B. So the largest ring which is at the bottom in column A will have to go
to the bottom of column B. This is possible if we can move the top 6 rings to column C and then we can move ring 7 to column B and after that we can move back the 6 rings from column C to Column B.
Thinking this problem further we can see that we need to move top 5 rings first to column B and then move ring 6 to column C and there after we can move those 5 rings to column c. So 
you get the idea that we need to keep analyzing this down to a single ring and reverse the process from there.</p>
<p>We have put together this animation to show ypu those steps as they happen. Click on  the submit button which will ask you for the number of rings
ypu want to see in the animation. </p>
